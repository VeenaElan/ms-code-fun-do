VOTING ADVICE APPLICATION (VAA)  
  
Our codefundo project will be a Voting Advice Application.  

The motivation to create this application comes from a problem we are witnessing in people of our age group. Most young voters (ages 18-24) don't vote. That is not because young people don't care or that they are too lazy as some people may think. Most young people don't have faith in our country's politics and feel like they are the last group of people politicians care about. They also feel their vote will not make a difference. This mindset is toxic for our democracy. Since young people don't vote enough, politicians also don't feel the need to look into their problems. This could be the reason for their broken promises on matters concerning the youth like employment.  
  
Another main reason young people are not voting is because they are ill informed. Most of them cannot differentiate between major political parties and don't know enough on what is going on politically. The solution to this problem is giving them access to information in a format they would like. The Voting Advice Application does just that.  
  
**The VAA will be a web application. It is an online quiz for voters to answer questions about their opinions and have them matched to the political party that stands closest to their preferences.** The idea is not to tell people how to vote. Rather, it is about informing people of the policies of the different political parties and to provide a starting point for further discussion and education. **The results screen ranks the political parties in order of which was the closest match to the user’s answers. It also provides a breakdown of where all the parties stand on each statement, along with links to the party’s website and other websites where the issues are debated in detail.**

Advantages of VAAs in elections:

1) Focuses people’s attention on the party programmes and on policy issues, compelling parties to discuss substance instead of personalities, images and campaign events.
2) Avoids confusion when there are a large number of political parties. The voter need not go through the policies and manifestos of all the political parties and it's candidates, which is nearly impossible. They can identify their most preferred party by taking a quiz which is something that will be more preferred by the younger generation.  
3) Motivates users to engage in further research about party policies and thereby motivates participation in the election.

**The application will be hosted on Microsoft Azure.**
**The VAA will also collect and save the answers selected by users anonymously and that way it can be used to create reports that show the overall opinion of people who took the test.** This data can be used to create many kinds of different reports such as average distribution reports and comparisons. These different reporting methods help for example, media channels to create interesting news and raise topics of conversation in debates. 
**MS Azure blockchain tools will be used to ensure the data collected from the users is kept secure.**
